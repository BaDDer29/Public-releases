# 0.7.6.3

### Scripting Department

- The EAEU has been reworked.

According to our idea, the EEU is a more centrist alliance than the EU, however, in the past, the EEU was considered as a kind of USSR 2.0 with a stupid imitation of its neighbors.

Now, the EEU is the economic union that it should be.

Specifically for the EEU, it was necessary to develop a kind of system of supranational unions.

> Similarity because, according to the developer himself, it does not reach the title of the system.

26 tricks were developed instead of 4. However, in addition to their increase, these focuses are available for all countries that may be the EEU, however, they will appear only after joining the EEU.

We have developed a lot of solutions specifically for the EEU, at the moment, their number is 36 pieces.

With the development of the EAEU, the capabilities of the union itself will expand. However, it should be borne in mind that it will not be very cheap. You will need a huge amount of money.

However, all members of the EEU will be able to explore different focuses and thus invest in the EEU.

The Eurasian Fund, also known as the Eurasian Bank in further development, will serve as the general budget of the EAEU, as well as the possibility of financing all-Union infrastructure projects.

However, if you fail to fulfill your membership obligations, you may be excluded from the EEU, along with this you will lose all the effects and investments.

Initially, the EEU bank will not be available, but everything is understood with development.

The EEU will expand freely, unlike the EU. The leader of the EAEU will make the decision on joining.

Also, the leadership of the EAEU will be transferred every year between all its members.

The EEU also has its own diplomacy in development from the participating countries.
