After a series of unsuccessful attempts to establish a dialogue with the regime of President Abd Rabb Mansour Hadi, the houthises launched a massive offense against the largest Yemeni cities, including the capital Sanu, and captured a large territory of the country. \nPresident Hadi was forced to resign from power. The president first fled from Sana to Aden, where he was granted a temporary residence. \n\The presence of Al-Qaeda in region have increased, with them attacking a number of key settlements in the north of the country and abducting local population. It is time to decide who is worth of our own support."
