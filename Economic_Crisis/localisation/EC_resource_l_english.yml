 iron_ore:0 "Iron ore"
 iron_ore_desc:0 "Iron ores are natural mineral formations containing iron and its compounds in such a volume when industrial extraction of iron from these formations is expedient. Despite the fact that iron is included in more or less amount in all rocks, by the name of iron ores they understand only such accumulations of ferrous compounds, from which it is possible to obtain metallic iron economically."
 PRODUCTION_MATERIALS_IRON_ORE:0 "Iron ore"
 uran:0 "Uranium"
 uran_desc:0 "Uranium is a very heavy, silvery-white glossy metal. In its pure form, it is slightly softer than steel, malleable, flexible, has small paramagnetic properties. The range of its use is very wide - from nuclear energy to bullets with depleted Uranium, not to mention its use in the production of weapons of mass destruction."
 PRODUCTION_MATERIALS_URAN:0 "Uranium"
 bauxite:0 "Bauxite"
 bauxite_desc:0 "Bauxite is an aluminum ore consisting of hydrates of aluminum oxide, oxides of iron and silicon, raw materials for the production of alumina and alumina refractories. It is also used as a flux in ferrous metallurgy. Currently, Bauxite is the most important aluminum ore, on which, with a few exceptions, almost the entire global aluminum industry is based."

 energy:0 "Energy"
 energy_resource:0 "Energy resource"
 energy_resource_desc:0 "Various combustible fossil fuels are widely used as fuel: coal, natural gas, less often - fuel oil, earlier - peat and oil shale. The energy resource is used at TPPs to produce electricity."
 PRODUCTION_MATERIALS_ENERGY_RESOURCE:0 "Energy resource"
 enr_uran:0 "Enriched uranium"
 enr_uran_desc:0 "Uranium with a content of 235U over 20% is called highly enriched or weapon uranium. At the dawn of the nuclear era, several types of cannon-based uranium nuclear weapons with an enrichment of about 90% were built. A highly enriched Uranium can be used in a thermonuclear weapon as a tamper (crimping shell) of a thermonuclear charge. In addition, a highly enriched Uranium is used in nuclear power reactors with a long-lasting fuel campaign (that is, with rare reloads or no rebooting at all), for example, in spacecraft reactors or ship-borne reactors."

 alloy_ore:0 "Alloy metal ores" 
 alloy_ore_desc:0 "Alloy metal ores"
 PRODUCTION_MATERIALS_ALLOY_ORE:0 "Alloy metal ores"
 alloy_steel:0 "Alloy metals"
 alloy_steel_desc:0 "In metallurgy, the doping is carried out mainly by the introduction into the melt or mixture of additional substances (for example, in steel — chromium, nickel, molybdenum), which improve the mechanical, physical and chemical properties of the alloy. Different types of surface alloying are also used to change various properties (increase in hardness, wear resistance, corrosion resistance, etc.) of the surface layer of metals and alloys. Doping is carried out at various stages of obtaining a metallic material with the aim of improving the quality of metallurgical products and metal products."
 PRODUCTION_MATERIALS_ALLOY_STEEL:0 "Alloy metals"
 rare_earth_ore:0 "Rare earth ore"
 rare_earth_ore_desc:0 "The name \"rare-earth\" is given in connection with the fact that, firstly, they are relatively rare in the earth's crust and, secondly, they form refractory oxides, which are practically insoluble in water. Despite the widespread prevalence of rare-elements, their concentrations in the earth's crust are quite low. Rare-earth elements are used in various branches of technology: in electronics, instrument making, nuclear engineering, mechanical engineering, chemical industry, in metallurgy, etc."
 PRODUCTION_MATERIALS_RARE_EARTH_ORE:0 "Rare earth ore"
 rare_metals:0 "Rare Metals"
 rare_metals_desc:0 "Rare elements - the conventional name of a large group of elements (over 60), which includes lithium, beryllium, gallium, indium, germanium, vanadium, titanium, molybdenum, tungsten, rare-earth elements, and also inert gases."
 PRODUCTION_MATERIALS_RARE_METALS:0 "Rare Metals"
 polymers:0 "Polymers"
 polymers_desc:0 "Polymers include numerous natural compounds: proteins, nucleic acids, polysaccharides, rubber, and other organic substances. A large number of polymers are produced synthetically on the basis of the simplest compounds of elements of natural origin by means of polymerization, polycondensation and chemical transformations. The names of polymers are formed from the name of the monomer with the prefix poly-: polyethylene, polypropylene, polyvinyl acetate, etc. Thanks to their valuable properties, Polymers are used in mechanical engineering, the textile industry, agriculture, medicine, automobile and shipbuilding, aviation and in everyday life (textile and leather goods, dishes, glue and varnishes, jewelry and other items). Based on high-molecular compounds, rubbers, fibers, plastics, films and paint coatings are manufactured. All tissues of living organisms are high-molecular compounds."
