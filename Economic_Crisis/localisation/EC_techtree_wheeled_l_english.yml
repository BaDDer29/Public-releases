 truck_g0_equipment_0:0 "The post-war generation of army trucks"
 truck_g0_equipment_0_desc:0 "The experience of the Second World War seriously affected the development of the organization of cargo transportation to supply troops. This generation of army trucks includes advanced solutions from the late 1940s and early 1950s, and experience gained during World War II and the Korean War."
 truck_g1_equipment_0:0 "Trucks I"
 truck_g1_equipment_0_desc:0 "The conflicts of the early 1950s were marked by the massive introduction of new tactics and weapons, which undoubtedly affected the sharply increased level of supply consumption - one of the main tasks of the army truck. However, the main requirement for army freight transport is patency, it is undoubtedly higher, although at the cost of an order of magnitude greater fuel consumption."
 truck_g2_equipment_0:0 "Trucks II"
 truck_g2_equipment_0_desc:0 "The past army transport models, although they had great cross-country ability, were too "gluttonous" for fuel, which does not have the best effect on the cost of using these trucks. Newer models are more passable at the cost of increased fuel consumption."
 truck_g3_equipment_0:0 "Trucks III"
 truck_g3_equipment_0_desc:0 "The development of technology allows new trucks to significantly reduce fuel consumption at the cost of some reduced cross-country ability."
 truck_g4_equipment_0:0 "Trucks IV"
 truck_g4_equipment_0_desc:0 "The latest technical advances can significantly increase the permeability of the truck, without increasing fuel consumption. Bulletproof armoring also begins to be applied in a limited way to better protect the crew and the main components of the truck from damage by small arms."
 truck_g5_equipment_0:0 "Trucks V"
 truck_g5_equipment_0_desc:0 "The new technical solutions used in this machine can significantly increase the throughput and carrying capacity of the truck, thoroughly expanding the tactical capabilities of our units. A modern army truck has throughput and carrying capacity that no truck had before."
 truck_g6_equipment_0:0 "Perspective Armored Trucks I"
 truck_g6_equipment_0_desc:0 "The protection of the crew has become a promising direction for army freight transport, as it is possible to make new equipment, and it is sometimes very difficult to replace a trained soldier. We should also not forget about the safety and protection of personnel delivered by this transport to the scene of operations in a combat situation, from defeat by enemy fire. An excellent solution to this problem is to equip vehicles with armor providing protection against small arms. "
 truck_g7_equipment_0:0 "Perspective Armored Trucks II"
 truck_g7_equipment_0_desc:0 "The installation of more powerful engines allows you to strengthen the reservation of the car, equipping additional vehicles with protection also from certain types of mines, which significantly increases the security of personnel."

 light_utility_vehicle_g1_equipment_0_desc:0 "The experience of the Second World War showed the effectiveness and wide range of applications of light cross-country vehicles, which can be used as a headquarters and reconnaissance vehicle, carrier infantry and the wounded, or as a light artillery tractor."
 light_utility_vehicle_g2_equipment_0:0 "Light off-road vehicle II"
 light_utility_vehicle_g2_equipment_0_desc:0 "The new generation of light off-road vehicles is characterized by increased cross-country ability, as well as increased fuel consumption, but they also have a greater carrying capacity."
 light_utility_vehicle_g3_equipment_0:0 "Light armored vehicle III"
 light_utility_vehicle_g3_equipment_0_desc:0 "The problem of protecting personnel when transporting light off-road vehicles resulted in the idea of ​​creating an all-terrain vehicle that has cross-country ability not inferior to an army jeep, but having armor that will protect personnel from small arms."
 light_utility_vehicle_g4_equipment_0:0 "Light armored vehicle IV"
 light_utility_vehicle_g4_equipment_0_desc:0 "The concept of a light armored all-terrain vehicle proved to be quite successful and effective. However, the emergence of new types of weapons and new tactics of warfare requires updating protection from modern types of small arms and light mines."
 light_utility_vehicle_g5_equipment_0:0 "Light all-terrain vehicle V"
 light_utility_vehicle_g5_equipment_0_desc:0 "The innovative solution in the light all-terrain vehicle category was the modular design of the car, which allows even in the field to change the purpose of the car in a short time by installing the necessary modules - from a light truck to communication system modules, engineering and rear services."
 light_utility_vehicle_g6_equipment_0:0 "Perspective armored vehicle I"
 light_utility_vehicle_g6_equipment_0_desc:0 "Modern combat operations require greater security of personnel during transportation. It is proposed to install modern bulletproof and anti-fragmentation armor, as well as modular light infantry support tools."
 light_utility_vehicle_g7_equipment_0:0 "Perspective armored vehicle II"
 light_utility_vehicle_g7_equipment_0_desc:0 "Further development of the armored all-terrain vehicle re-equipped with the latest technology, from the latest protection products -" smart "bulletproof and anti-fragmentation armor and a system of modular light infantry support weapons with a friend or foe identification system."
