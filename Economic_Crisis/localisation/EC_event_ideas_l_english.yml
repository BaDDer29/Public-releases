 preference_religion.1.d:0 "A group of deputies, having enlisted the support of several members of the government, came up with an initiative aimed at supporting the religious education of the population. They propose to allocate funds for various religious events, the introduction of religious instruction in educational institutions. This is justified by the fact that modern society is losing its spirituality, invariably mired in the Fall, which will inevitably lead to the death of society and the country as a whole. Expanding the participation of religious dogmas in everyday life will significantly help overcome the spiritual decline of the nation."

 treocracy.1.d:0 "Religion in our country has gained such influence that religious figures are increasingly interfering in state affairs. In the government and parliament, the idea of merging church and state, giving the church the status of a state authority, is gaining more and more popularity. However, it should be remembered that leaders of other religions will not be too happy about the introduction of a state religion.."

 state_religion.1.d:0 "According to sociology, an increasing percentage of our population lives according to religious norms. Of course, in the desire to save the people from spiritual degeneration, the state may go too far. However, it should be understood that in any society there are and will be things that contradict the doctrines of religion. There is a proposal to introduce religious doctrines into legislation in order to avoid tensions in society."
