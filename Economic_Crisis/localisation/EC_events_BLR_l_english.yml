Also, communication, Internet and electricity lines can be located inside the rail. This will simplify communications to remote regions. Rails for SkyWay transport are located above the ground between the supports, forming an overpass. Rising above the ground, string transport halves the aerodynamic drag, which means it spends half the fuel. The first such overpass stretched from Brest to Minsk, and from Minsk to Vitebsk.
