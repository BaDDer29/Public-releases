 afghanistan.3.t:0 "Civil War in Afghanistan"
 afghanistan.3.d:0 "After the capture of Kabul by mujahideen units in 1992, the former "wrestling brothers" began an internecine struggle for power. A radical Islamist Taliban movement emerged in this whirlwind. In early 1995, the Taliban captured Helmand, defeated the fighters of field commander Gulbeddin Hekmatyar, but were stopped by the troops of field commander Ahmad Shah Masood near Kabul. In September 1996, the Taliban took Kabul without a fight and founded the Islamic Emirates of Afghanistan. In the controlled territory, they introduced strict sharia law. Opposition to the Taliban regime was made up of the Northern Alliance, consisting mainly of the Tajik (led by Ahmad Shah Masood and Burhanudin Rabbani) and the Uzbek (led by General Abdul-Rashid Dostum), who enjoyed Russian support. The provision of shelter to the terrorist Osama bin Laden and the destruction of monuments of Buddhist architecture (Bamyan Buddha statues) led to the formation of a negative image of the Taliban in the eyes of the world public. Since the early 2000s, Waziristan has been a stronghold of the Taliban movement. The United States is conducting an operation in Afghanistan as part of Operation Enduring Freedom, launched in response to the terrorist attack of September 11, 2001. The International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan (ISAF) operates in accordance with UN Security Council Resolution N1386 of 20 December 2001. This is the longest war in U.S. history. The gradual withdrawal of coalition troops from Afghanistan began in July 2011. In July 2013, security in the country was transferred to local security structures, since which time the coalition contingent has played a supporting role. In fact, the war was only formally over, and in fact continued on."

In any case, we have dealt a serious blow to the Taliban, the stones and sand here, which in thousands of years of war have absorbed so much blood will remember us for it.
