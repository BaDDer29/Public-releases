 libya.1.t:0 "ISIS invades Northern Libya"
 libya.1.d:0 "Today we've recieved reports of numerous border crossing by land in sea - the tresspassers are armed and walk under black flag of ISIS. \n\n General-major of Libyan National Army Khalipha Haftar announced a full-scale military retaliation and threw a call for his army loyalists to gather near Benghasi. He described this operation as "a little pit-stop on a way to Revolution". This military operation was codenamed "Operation "Dignity". After short time the area of operation was expanded to Tripoli, with inevitable storm of Libyan General National Congress' building. In the atmosphere of high tension an election in House of Representatives has been held, where fundamentalists and radical Islamists were denied right of representation and thus lost the election. As countermeausre, radical Islamists launched their own military operation with codename "Libyan Dawn" which aims to take control of Tripoli's airport. This turn of events led us to another civil war. The only question is who will we support?"

 libya_news.1.t:0 "Libyan Civil War!"
 libya_news.1.d:0 "The second Libyan Civil War is a conflict among rival groups seeking control of the territory of Libya. The conflict has been mostly between the government of the House of Representatives (HoR) that was elected democratically in 2014, also known as the "Tobruk government" and internationally recognized as the "Libyan government"; and the rival General National Congress (GNC) endorsed government, also called the "National Salvation Government", based in the capital Tripoli established after Operation Libya Dawn. The HoR also known as the House of Representatives, strongest in eastern Libya, has the loyalty of the Libyan National Army under the command of General Khalifa Haftar and has been supported by air strikes by Egypt and the UAE. The GNC, backed by "Libya Dawn", Qatar, Sudan and Turkey, initially accepted the results of the 2014 election, but rejected them after the Supreme Constitutional Court nullified an amendment regarding the roadmap for Libya's transition and HoR elections."
