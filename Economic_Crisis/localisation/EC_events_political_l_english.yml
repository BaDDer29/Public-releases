 islamism.1.d:0 "Recent polls showed that islamist parties and aligned movements are gaining support - around 10 % of total population follows these ideas. It would be right to expect those parties to be more demanding and influential so. If left unchecked, that may upset the balance of political powers. We could form a coalition with them and set on mutual ground, or we can secede them a few seats in parliament to prevent them from acting on their own. Of course, we could try to shift opinion and turn in to our favor by critisizing key figures and ideology of conservatives - or we could simply ignore them and govern the nation regardless of facts."

Our democratic systems implies we cannot ignore this development - after all, 25% is just halfway farther than so needed 51% at the elections.

If people are to spring out on the streets, situation may turn volatile. We can have a reprisal of our own - a few fabricated cases, arrests and intimidation may put them out of mind, but this certainly anger populace in a long term, not to say the world community. We could certainly negotiate some preemptive concessions with them to buy stability with small blood; and, of course, we could just let them plot to their hearts' content - that may be seen as a weakness and subjugation before Islam, though."
