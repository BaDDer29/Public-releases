 russia.1.t:0 "The government of Mongolia requests assistance from Russia against Chinese threat!"
 russia.1.d:0 "Our foreign intelligence reports that there have been numerous skirmishes alongside Sino-Mongolian border. They hadn’t gain wide acknowledgment, but whole situation may escalate into full border conflict very quickly. Mongolian government claims that China has sent them ultimative demands of full obedience and immediate diplomatic de-facto annexation - but they’ve refused such treaty by the very means, and that has resulted in a partial mobilisation of PLA near Inner Mongolia’s borders. Mongols beg us to intervene and calm down the Chinese, as they see us as the only power potent of such action.\n Mongolia was a buffer between us and Chinese people in all times and it is very important as this buffer even by today.\nWe can hope to stall the Chinese by officially declaring our protection over Mongolia. However, in the light of recent events this statement may get Beijing very angry. \nIf we officially support Mongolia, then we can stop China for a short time, but long-term consequences are hard to predict. \nWhat’s your decision, Mr. President?"
 russia.1.a:0 "We guarantee independence of Mongolia!"
 russia.1.b:0 "We can’t risk our relationships with China!"
 
 russia.2.t:0 "Today our bomber Su-24M has been shot down by Turkish Air Force"

It happened near syrian-turkish border on 6000 metres high in airspace of syrian province Latakia in Bayirbucak. \n\n Bomber crew ejected: crew commander Podpolkovnik Oleg Peshkov was killed by anti-government armed groups during the landing by parachute. Captain Konstantin Murachtin has successfully landed."
 russia.2.a:0 "They must apologise! We begin search and rescue operation"
 
 russia.3.t:0 "Question with Eastern Ukraine"
 russia.3.d:0 "The return of Crimea was met by rising patriotic spirit in Russia. In spite of today's international relations most of the government concluded that from this event was more good than bad. It was the first time when our country claimed on post-Soviet space. However, despite received territories, we are in precarious situation - international sanctions are pressing our imports-focused industry and people began to lose hope in Russia recovery not as regional state but as international country. In this regard radical government members encourage to continue course on returning territories - send to weakened by internal conflicts Ukraine an ultimatum to organise a referendum on self-determination, which, of course, will be held in our favor. If Kiev refuses, we will have a reason to conduct a military operation to restore order in the Eastern Ukraine. But other countries, which restricted by sanctions, may go to more resolute countermeasures. Should we send an ultimatum, Mr. President?"
 russia.3.a:0 "Send an ultimatum"
 russia.3.b:0 "Refuse"
 
 russia.4.t:0 "The Ultimatum from Russia"
 russia.4.d:0 "[RUS.GetLeader] declared that he considers Eastern Ukraine “as our common heritage and the most important stability factor in the area”; therefore he thinks that “this strategic territory must be protected by strong and stable sovereignty which, in fact, could be only russian today”. It is obvious that Kremlin lost any diplomatic caution and tries to benefit from our oddness. At the present time, when we have many internal enemies and eastern territories are harmful sentiments, our refusal may provocate separatists and military intervention of Russia. Of course, our faithful european friends will help us. But the question is, will they arrive at time? How should we proceed?"
 russia.4.a:0 "Accept"
 russia.4.b:0 "Refuse"
 
 russia.5.t:0 "Ukraine has agreed"
 russia.5.d:0 "Today Kiev sent us official letter in which recognizes the self-determination right of ukrainian people, despite restrictions related to declared state of emergency. In Donetsk and Luhansk were held completely independent referendums in which 98 percent of population voted for integration with Russia. It is obvious that ukrainians are enraged but today we are celebrating our victory without firing a shot - at least for now. Now Eastern Ukraine is part of Russian Federation!"
 russia.5.a:0 "Exellent!"
 
 russia.6.t:0 "Ukraine refuses"
 russia.6.d:0 "Today directed to us Kiev protest makes clear that our ultimatum, despite unequivocal threat of military conflict in case of refusal, didn’t have the desired effect; Ukraine expands conscription and on the borderline has been declared a heightened alert. Russian ambassador has been convoyed at gunpoint to border crossing point and our reputation was dealt yet another, much more severe this time hit. West is silent, but we will have to act decisively and quickly - if we do not immediately lead the troops into Ukraine, there will be a threat of pre-emptive strike by the coalition of European powers."
 russia.6.a:0 "This means war"
 
 russia.7.t:0 "The ultimatum from Russia"
 russia.7.d:0 "In a recent Moscow ultimatum effortlessly recognizes their desire to return territories of Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republic. Kiev answer is still unknown to us but, despite our wish to be with Russia, they have once cast us adrift - after Crimea annexation. Where guarantees that Moscow did not show indecision and will not go back on their word again? On the other hand, perhaps it is now good opportunity to show determination to ourselves and to hold a referendum on integration. The results, of course, no one will accept, with the exception of Russia, but the russian only need a precedent to intervene. However, in this case, our government will have to resign and our independent republic will become part of the Russian Federation. Whether we agree completely with the requirements of Russia or we have shed blood enough to be called a sovereign state?"
 russia.7.a:0 "Organise a referendum!"
 russia.7.b:0 "We have deserved an independence!"
 
 russia.8.t:0 "LDPR has agreed"
 russia.8.d:0 "Donetsk and Luhansk republics fully supported our claims for Eastern Ukraine and have already asked us to locate governing bodies in their capitals. From this time forward instead of self-proclaimed republics there are Luhansk and Donetsk oblasts as a part of Russian Federation! The crowds on the streets of our cities rejoices and celebrates but there are those who fears a full-scale war against NATO - this chains of events oblige US to change sanctions on a fundamentally different level and to intervene - perhaps even using military forces. However, one thing is clear - the east of Ukraine fully acknowledged the legitimacy of our rule and requirements."
 russia.8.a:0 "The obvious choice"
 
 russia.9.t:0 "LDPR refuses"
 russia.9.d:0 "We are an independent state that has passed through many sufferings to just surrender! Russia had a legitimate chance to take us under his wing but they betrayed us and left at the mercy of butchers! We will not believe it for a second time! If Russia wants to be together with us, they need to conduct a dialogue as equals!\" - declared the leader of LDNR [DON.GetLeader]. The main representatives of our country are shocked by such statement but it seems to be final. Luhansk and Donetsk People's Republics have rejected our seemingly fully justifiable and the expected assumption of the acceptance of our right to the land of those republics. Despite this statement, the armed conflict seems to be unavoidable - Kiev was also infuriated by the performance of the proud republics and the war may take a tripartite nature."
 russia.9.a:0 "Everything went not as we planned..."
 
 russia.10.t:0 "Establishment of the EEC"
 russia.10.d:0 "How profitable is the creation of a new union? The former Soviet republics deepened their trade ties with Europe and China in recent years. The EU is now the main trading partner of Kazakhstan and Armenia, while China is the leading trade partner of Kyrgyzstan. At the same time, notes Popescu, the volume of trade between Russia, Belarus and Kyrgyzstan declined by 7% last year. The Eurasian Union will promote trade between member countries, increasing duties on goods from other countries. What this can lead to can already be seen in Kazakhstan, which raised import duties by joining the Customs Union created before the new economic bloc."
 russia.10.a:0 "Sign the agreement"
 russia.10.b:0 "Refuse"
 
 russia.11.t:0 "Crimean referendum 16th of March."
 russia.11.d:0 "16th of March completely went through all-Crimean referendum for status of republick. The greater part of the population of the Crimea votes to joining peninsula in Russia. March 17 in the territory of Crimea was unilaterally proclaimed the Republic of Crimea (which included Sevastopol as a city with a special status). The new state appealed to the Russian government, requesting membership in the federation."
