The main disadvantage of rocket artillery systems is the relatively high dispersion of shells."

 ### Trench mortars ###
 TRENCH_MORTAR_arch:0 "Mortars"
 TRENCH_MORTAR_1:0 "Light mortar"
 TRENCH_MORTAR_1_desc:0 "The mortar is a light artillery fire support weapon, and besides, it is easily transported by infantry directly on itself. The mortar shoots its ammunition (mine) along a high path, which allows you to hit targets behind the hills, in narrow streets, in ravines and trenches. A mortar can be a very simple system: just throw a shell into the barrel and shoot at such a speed that a soldier can throw shells into the barrel (20 rounds per minute; it is quite possible to throw every three seconds)."	
 TRENCH_MORTAR_2:0 "Self-propelled mortar"
 TRENCH_MORTAR_2_desc:0 "A kind of self-propelled artillery mounts (self-propelled guns), characterized by the use of a mortar as the main weapon of a combat vehicle. Structurally, self-propelled mortars are a heterogeneous group, including both carriers of company or battalion mortars of a caliber of about 81-120 mm, and heavy artillery systems with a caliber of up to 240 mm, and in exceptional cases more."
 TRENCH_MORTAR_4:0 "Medium mortar"
 TRENCH_MORTAR_4_desc:0 "An average mortar is considered, the caliber of which is from 80 mm. The range of such a mortar, capable of firing high-explosive, smoke, lighting and armor-piercing shells, is slightly lower than that of a lung and the damaging effect is not higher than that."
