 GER_strengthening_eu:0 "Strengthen the EU"
 GER_strengthening_eu_desc:0 "Even though we managed to establish balance in power, European Union still can be in threat should euroscepticists or even authoritarists rise in power in the rest of EU's countries. We cannot allow this to happen and should prevent this by pressing restricting law packages against anti-legalism and seccesionism."
 GER_impact_on_eu:0 "Influence on EU countries"

 GER_lead_eu_effect:0 "Will recieve an offer of puppeting from Germany. If agrees, civil war will broke out, and after victory in war it will become German puppet. If not, it will leave the Union."
 GER_eurointegration:0 "Eurointegration"

 GER_unity_europe:0 "One Europe"
 GER_unity_europe_desc:0 "European nations share a lot of history together - be it of violence or friendship. One thing is true - thanks to our efforts, those nations now have only nominal borders and differences. One last push is required to make Europa united once and for all!"
 GER_euroscepticism:0 "Euroscepticism"
 GER_euroscepticism_desc:0 "There is no way European nations will work towards common good of the Union - they have too much problems on their own, too big of a gap in their economies right now. We must find a way to preserve European unity somehow else."
 GER_stay_democratic:0 "Keep the Democracy"
 GER_stay_democratic_desc:0 "A most disdainable experience of authoritarian and totalitarian regimes during previous century must have proved that there is only one way Germany can prosper - by ensuring and pushing further people's freedoms, liberties and equalities."
 GER_conservatism_focus:0 "Go Conservative"
 GER_conservatism_focus_desc:0 "Changes made to our way of living often prove to be too hasty to be good. Even though we accept modern tendencies, we must move very careful towards them - lest they can turn to be perverted justifications of consumerist society."
 GER_liberalism_focus:0 "Go Liveral"
 GER_liberalism_focus_desc:0 "People should have more rights and freedoms - they are consciencious enough to govern themselves!"
 GER_socialism_focus:0 "Go Socialism"
 GER_socialism_focus_desc:0 "Governments historically are instruments of opression, way of installing forceful compromise between people - but we can alleviate some of this by turning our government into more humane, caring form. Let's give our people a wide variety of goods and services in exchange for their obedience and loyalty."
 GER_interventionism:0 "Interventionism"

 GER_intervention_to_syria:0 "Syrian Intervention"
 GER_intervention_to_syria_desc:0 "Syria today is the boiling point of our planet. Diplomats are desperate to find something to stop the fight, but we, in the meantime, must send forces to protect democracy and throw down the opressing regime."
 GER_confrontation_with_russia:0 "Confront Russia"
 GER_confrontation_with_russia_desc:0 "Russia has lost most of it's power in 1991, when Soviet Union fell apart, but Russians still act like they own the Europe in their sphere. They've shown us there is no peace - then let us show them there can be a big wat in return."
 GER_confrontation_with_russia_effect:0 "Russia will have a casus belly to start a war."
 GER_exit_eu:0 "Quit the EU"

 GER_exit_eu_finish:0 "Cut the ties with EU"
 GER_exit_eu_finish_desc:0 "The decision to left the EU is now absolute and justified. The only thing left to do is to cut remaining ties with the rest of Commonwealth and negotiate passage rights between the rest members."
 GER_cope_exit_eu_consequences:0 "Restore GerExit damage"
 GER_cope_exit_eu_consequences_desc:0 "Obviously, our decision to quit the EU didn't go unnoticed for our own economy - a lot of interunion companies closed down, buisinesses went bankrupt and large portion of our people are unemployed now. Still, we don't have a supervisor now to tell us what to do, so we can repair the damage starting today."
 GER_new_political_way:0 "New Political Way"
 GER_new_political_way_desc:0 "Migration policy, constant bickering among European countries, mistrust and backdoor intrigues made it impossible to live with so-called Commonwealth in peace. We must take what is ours by force - and we will!"

 GER_gdr_revival:0 "Restore the GDR"
 GER_gdr_revival_desc:0 "German Democratic Republic - the puppet state of Soviet Union - was annexed by Federal Republic of Germany, the lapdog of the West.

It is time to officialy declare our manifesto - "for the workers, by the workers!"."
 GER_nationalism:0 "Nationalism"
 GER_nationalism_desc:0 "Germany once was nothing more than a pile of rivaling city-states. It took a lot of time to forge a single nation out of those, but this nation is astonishing. We lead the world technology and industry, our people are among the best in the world. Let us make others to see this splendior of ours as well."
 GER_reich_revival:0 "The Fourth Reich"
 GER_reich_revival_desc:0 "The Third Reich was so close to bending the world to their knees - but treachery and bad fortune stopped it from victory merely few steps away. But what the Third Reich couldn't do, the Fourth Reich will do perfectly."
 GER_monarchism:0 "Monarchy"
 GER_monarchism_desc:0 "Before the Great War, German Empire had immenense potential, it's consumer goods were the worst nightmare for English industrialists, and it's nave could contest the Royal Fleet. Strong leadership of benevolent monarch is more preferable today to jack-of-all-trades democracy and violent totalitarian dictatorships."
 GER_empire_revival:0 "Revive the Empire"

 GER_tumult_in_europe:0 "Turmoils in Europe"
 GER_tumult_in_europe_desc:0 "As expected, our propaganda campaign was a huge success. Countries are plunged into chaos, with people demanding radical changes and nations standing on the brink of civil war. If pro-German forces are victorious, those countries can be, say, persuaded to join our great nation on our terms."
 GER_anchluss_again:0 "New Anschluss!"
 GER_anchluss_again_desc:0 "Osterreich, or Austria, is our most loyal neighbor. Austrians share cultural bonds and common history with us, and even 1938 doesn't cast a shade on possibility to bring them back to prospering German nation again. We expect little opposition to this reunion."
 GER_territory_return:0 "Reclaim former territories"
 GER_territory_return_desc:0 "Two Great Wars didn't stop mankind from violence, but surely strip Germany of vital provinces. With German might on the rise, it is time to prove our contestants wrong."
 GER_claims_on_poland:0 "Claim Western Poland"
 GER_claims_on_poland_desc:0 "Poland took the most of core states from Germany. They thought they can keep it forever, especially with European protection and support of the Western democracies. How bold of them - with Europe temporarily out of the game and USA overseas, we now can freely demand our territory back. Should they decline, the history of 1939 might repeat itself."
 GER_war_with_france:0 "War with France"
 GER_war_with_france_desc:0 "France has gone soft, it's people are dissatisfied with government course of action. It will take little effort to provoke them into violence and then "restoring the rightful order" on their territory with the steel of our weapon."
 GER_finland_friend:0 "Befriend Finland"
 GER_finland_friend_desc:0 "Finnish people are robust and steady, they've been valuable allies back in the days of old. It is time to rejuvenate our friendship by establishing trade and cooperation on the highest level!"
 GER_baltic_sea_bases:0 "Baltic Sea Bases"
 GER_baltic_sea_bases_desc:0 "Germany needs more sea bases. Sweden can provide us theirs so we can protect both sides of Baltic strait. If they dare to refuse, we would have to turn to violence, however."
 GER_northern_sea_bases:0 "Northern Sea Bases"
 GER_northern_sea_bases_desc:0 "Time to expand our naval influence even more. We've already negotiated a rent of Norwegian small ports, but that is nearly not enough. We don't have time to dilly-dally with them, so we have to claim it by force. However, this blatant action surely can be a final straw for NATO to intervene."
 GER_demand_kenigsberg:0 "Demand K?nigsberg"
 GER_demand_kenigsberg_desc:0 "K?nigsberg is the ancient German city in Eastern Pomerania. Russia took it during Soviet rule as military supply port and fortified occupation zone, but now they've exhausted their right to hold it. Russia will give it back or face consequences."
 GER_war_with_russia:0 "War with Russia"
 GER_war_with_russia_desc:0 "Russia brought enough troubles in the past for German plans. Both in Imperial times with their Panslavism and Soviet with their occupation. But Russian Federation is a weak, corrupt parody of a state, so this time we will end them prematurely, once and for all."
 GER_russia_friend:0 "Befriend Russia"
 GER_russia_friend_desc:0 "It is true our relationships with Russia is somewhat questionable - we've had our share of pain, we've had our share of friendship. Still, despite all of this, Russia can be a good ally in upcoming events. After all, should they turn out to be a bad equal, we can use their manpower as cannon fodder."
 GER_russia_friend_effect:0 "Soon enough an opportunity to propose a military allience to Russia will be available."

 GER_special_forces:0 "Kommando Spezialkrafte(KSK)"
 GER_special_forces_desc:0 "It takes more to win the war than hold the line and cry "Charge!". Special Forces can turn the tide of a battle - if properly used. We must encourage interaction between Special Forces and regular army"
 GER_aviation_effort:0 "Luftwaffe: Bundeswehr"
 GER_aviation_effort_tt:0 "Not enough free slots for §Yairports§!"

 GER_CAS_effort:0 "Develop Multitask Heli: MBB Bo 105"
 GER_CAS_effort_desc:0 "Standalone Close Air Support is a rudimentary legacy of past Cold War age; this is the exact reason why we should make universal aircraft capable of protecting itself and supporting tactical bombers in the same time by making surgical bomb strike."
