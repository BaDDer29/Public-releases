 lebanon.2.desc:0 "Today, August 4, 2020, two explosions thundered in the port of Beirut in the evening. A cargo of 2,750 tons of ammonium nitrate, removed in 2014 from the ship «Rhosus» and all this time stored in the port warehouse, exploded. The dangers of storing this cargo were reported to the government by port officials. Presumably, the explosions were due to welding. The sparks ignited the firecrackers, followed by them detonated saltpeter. The first, smaller explosion created a cloud of smoke over the flames and flickering lights. A second explosion shook central Beirut and sent a mushroom cloud of dust into the air. A crater with a diameter of about 70 meters, filled with water, has formed at the storage site. The explosions were reportedly heard at a distance of 240 kilometers - in Cyprus. As a result, at least 158 ​​people died, more than 6000 were injured. The damage caused is up to 15 billion dollars."
