 transistors:0 "Transistors"
 transistors_desc:0 "The discovery of a bipolar transistor allows us to develop a new type of field-effect transistor of a different type, in which the current modulation, in contrast to the previously proposed TIR structures, was carried out by changing the thickness of the conducting channel by expanding or narrowing the depleted area adjacent to the p-n-junction channel. This happened when the control voltage of the locking polarity of the gate diode was applied to the transition. The transistor was called "field-effect transistor with control p-n-junction" (surface phenomena interfering with the operation were eliminated, since the conducting channel was inside the crystal)."

 beginning_globalization_of_computer_networks:0 "Start of globalization comp. networks"
 beginning_globalization_of_computer_networks_desc:0 "It's time to start an ambitious project - the creation of a global network that could eventually unite computers around the world in a global information network. To begin with, we will create an internal network that will unite computers in our country. This is only the first step towards globalization..."
 global_computer_network:0 "Global Computer Network"
 global_computer_network_desc:0 "Draft local computer network was surprisingly very good. The development of a global network - International Network, will enable people around the world to communicate without any obstacles through computers. The electronic future is not far off. However, this technology also has a huge military potential..."
 quantum_computer_1:0 "Adaptation of quantum mechanics in computer technology"
 quantum_computer_1_desc:0 "Quantum mechanics (QM; also known as quantum physics, quantum theory, the wave mechanical model, or matrix mechanics), including quantum field theory, is a fundamental theory in physics which describes nature at the smallest scales of energy levels of atoms and subatomic particles. In theory, this means that if we can apply the principles of quantum mechanics to computer technology, we can get an extremely powerful computing device."
 quantum_computer_2:0 "Quantum computer"
 quantum_computer_2_desc:0 "A quantum computer is a device that performs quantum computing. Such a computer is completely different from binary digital electronic computers based on transistors and capacitors. Whereas common digital computing requires that the data be encoded into binary digits (bits), each of which is always in one of two definite states (0 or 1), quantum computation uses quantum bits or qubits, which can be in superpositions of states."
