  ARM_surrounded_by_enemies_desc:0 "Historically, Armenia has been squeezed between its sworn enemies, Turkey and Azerbaijan, and from the south it's periodically pressed by Muslim Iran. And since the Northern neighbor in the face of Georgia is extremely unreliable due to a number of historical contradictions, the Armenians have to rely only on themselves and constantly live in a semi-blockade situation."

  NGK_surrounded_by_enemies_desc:0 "The Armenians of Nagorno-Karabakh rebelled against Azerbaijan in the early 90s of the last century, and managed to detach themselves from Azerbaijan in the bloody war of 1991-1994 with the support of neighboring Armenia. However, in the XXI century, their fate is unenviable, they are surrounded by hostile Azerbaijan on 2 sides, and Muslim Iran is pressing them from the South. The only friend and ally, it's Armenia, which located in the west, is also in a semi-blockaded position, and in the event of a new big war, their fate will hang in the balance."

A series of Arab-Israeli wars in the middle of the XX century not only saved Israel from complete destruction, but also increased its territory by more than 2 times, and also created its reputation as a powerful country with an invincible army. However, even in the XXI century, this country is constantly threatened by its numerous and bitter enemies, and there will be no mercy from them."

  ikor_diplomatic_desc:0 "Thanks to its natural wealth and famous hospitality, Azerbaijan has a tradition of lavishing gifts on its guests in order to appease and earn their favor. This habit has also moved to the highest diplomatic level, and the country is often accused of improperly influencing foreign guests and diplomats by bribing their loyalty, which is contrary to the principles of international relations."

  oil_spike_desc:0 "The presence of large deposits of oil and very large revenues from its export cause a lack of real motivation and a real need for the development of the real production sector, since raw material revenues allow us to maintain a certain stable standard of living under the current state system and the structure of the economy. The country has become dependent on fluctuations in energy prices, and any market shock will inevitably hurt the economy."
