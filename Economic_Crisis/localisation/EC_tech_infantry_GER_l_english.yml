 GER_tech_infantry_ipfsw_1:0 "MG3"
 GER_tech_infantry_ipfsw_1_desc:0 "A single German machine gun. It's an improved version of the MG42. In MG3 machine guns, the tape receiver is modified so that it can use both tapes with non-loose links and loose ones. It features the same high rate of fire as its predecessor. The rate of fire in bursts depends on the mass of the bolt: the lighter the bolt, the higher the rate of fire of the machine gun. For MG3, two versions of sets of gates and return springs are available-the standard one (a bolt weighing about 600 grams), which provides a rate of fire of about 1200 rounds per minute."
