 hills:0 "Hills"
 hills_desc:0 " Hilly terrain, depending on the nature of the hills, valleys and ravines, can be closed or semi-closed.

 plains:0 "Plains"

 urban:0 "Urban"
 urban_desc:0 " Urban battles are considered one of the most difficult types of combined arms combat, significantly surpassing the complexity of combat in forests and mountains due to the fact that the urban area is characterized by highly rugged terrain, limited visibility, three-dimensionality (with multi-storey buildings) and a high density of convenient places for placing hidden firing points. As a result, combat operations in populated areas are characterized by the rapidity of a change in the operational situation, the fragmentation of actions into small skirmishes, difficulties with centralized command and control and coordination of troops, and ample opportunities for sudden and covert maneuvers. As a rule, combat operations of regular army units in an urban environment lead to significant destruction, fires, debris and loss of life."
 jungle:0 "Jungle"

 desert:0 "Desert"
 desert_desc:0 " Warfare in the desert is fraught with difficulties such as: \n - flat terrain; \n - difficulties with orientation, due to the rarity of landmarks on the ground; \n - heat. \n During the offensive, the struggle is mainly for mastering oases, large water sources, road junctions and other important areas, usually located at a great distance from each other."
