Friends, the Economic Crisis fashion needs help in collecting and organizing information on politicians, governments and military commanders of countries for November 1, 2013 and beyond. This implies a lot of work with sources in other languages ​​and we ourselves are not doing very well.<br>

The political mechanics of the mod are similar to those of HoI3. There are 6 main ideologies in the mod (bone):<br>
- socialism<br>
- reformism<br>
- centrism<br>
- liberalism<br>
- conservatism<br>
- nationalism<br>

+ game-technical radical Islam only for Islamic fundamentalists (available only through events).<br>

For each ideology, there should be a set of ministers, advisors and heads of state gravitating towards it, military ones are also possible, which become available only with a certain ideology.<br>

Government composition:<br>

- the leader of the state (depending on the law regulating the state structure - it can be a potential prime minister, president, monarch or dictator), he always corresponds to the ideology in power.<br>
- head of government (prime minister, vice president, etc., in parliamentary countries = the leader of the state, in the rest - the second person in the country)<br>
- Foreign Secretary<br>
- Minister of Defense<br>
- Minister of Economy<br>
- Minister of the Interior (Minister of Justice)<br>
- head of the internal security service (special services, counterintelligence)<br>

+ 3 advisor<br>

Ministers, with very rare exceptions, are adherents of a certain ideology, some may also be principled opponents of some other ideology. They become available to the player only if their ideology is in power, or if a coalition of their ideology with the currently ruling ideology is created by a special event. At the same time, if a person is a principled radical opponent of the ruling ideology, then he will not be available even with a coalition.<br>

Example: When nationalists come to Russia, a coalition with conservatives (soft nationalism) is possible with an eye to restoring the monarchy. Conservatives who are irreconcilable with nationalist ideas will never enter such a coalition.<br>

Also, some ministers and advisers may be available only under certain laws on the form of government, state structure, status of religion or level of corruption.<br>

Example 1: A popular sofa specialist and even a little practitioner I.S., adhering to certain views, is available as a minister under the ideologies of conservatism and nationalism, but only if Russia has one of the forms of monarchy.<br>

Example 2: In reality, Imam Abu, who is influential and popular in the international community, is available to his country as foreign minister only if Islam has become the state religion.<br>

Example 3: An experienced military commander and adviser, General D., who is a representative of a small but proud people, is available as such for his country only until his small people proclaims autonomy from a large country in one form or another. After the proclamation of autonomy, he goes over to the side of his small, but even more proud than before, people.<br>

Almost all ministers (candidates for government posts) can simultaneously be political advisers (as in vanilla). In the advisor status, personalities appear with other abilities, buffs and debuffs. You cannot make one advisor a candidate for several ministerial posts at once - only for one. Most political advisers are adherents of one or another ideology and give a bias to it. The steeper the main abilities of the advisor, the more he gives drift to his ideology. Alternative - a high buff is compensated by some kind of non-ideological debuff.<br>

At the same time, political advisers have a ranking of accessibility depending on the level of popularity in the country of the ideology to which they are close.<br>

With a level of ideology support of 0%, 1-2 per advisor are always available ideology - these are well-known and popular personalities who, despite their opposition, can be appointed to positions. However, they have low buffs!<br>

Further, there are barriers:<br>

10% popularity - regional representatives, deputies, effective reformers appear.<br>
25% popularity - active representatives of the top electorate appear - support for business, industry, etc.<br>
45% of popularity - advisers appear who can influence state affairs, the economy, be supporters of friendship / enmity with other countries, etc.
there is a coalition, or ideology is in power - we open all the rest.<br>

It must be understood that representatives of different ideologies must have their own strengths and weaknesses. So far we see it like this (very roughly and still under discussion):<br>

socialism (communism) - strengthening of special industry, the possibility of nationalization and mobilization of the economy, low taxes and an average social system, militarization.<br>
reformism (social democracy) - strengthening of the social sector, light industry, theoretical science, the possibility of nationalizing the extractive industry, the likelihood of non-alignment.<br>
centrism - strengthening of protection against changes in ideology, special services, intelligence, strong diplomats, increase in nat. unity and protection from the collapse of the country, reduction of consumer goods.<br>
liberalism - strengthening market buffs, economics, accelerating the construction of factories and stock exchanges, reducing the cost of research
conservatism - strengthening the economy, militarization, raising taxes, improving education, making the development of industry and construction of processing plants cheaper, etc.<br>
nationalism - militarization, protection from displacement, growth of nat. unity, population growth, acceleration of justifying the goals of war, closing borders<br>
Islamism - secularization, growth of nat. unity, population growth, rapprochement with Muslim countries<br>

Ask - why all this? For realism. In the future, we plan to introduce such an event mechanism with the support of ideology:<br>
> 10% - a warning that supporters of this ideology have become popular (we open advisors)<br>
> 25% - a warning that representatives of ideology are in parliament and it would be nice to give them at least a couple of ministerial seats (the possibility of creating a coalition or banning the activities of parties)<br>
> 45% and no coalition - a warning that ideology is very popular and there is a danger for our regime with a check> or <we have 45%, re-proposal to create a coalition or tough measures (the debuff will give more than 25%)<br>
> 50% is the coalition - the message that our party is losing its leadership and the next elections may become a defeat for us<br>
> 55% and there is no coalition - a message that people have taken to the streets and demand changes (early elections) - whether to appoint them or not<br>
> 70% and there is no coalition or scheduled elections - a message about an attempted coup or uprisings in some regions (an option is to resign or start a civil war).<br>

With the military, things are a little easier. There are such posts:<br>

- Head of the General Staff of the Armed Forces<br>
- commander-in-chief of the ground forces<br>
- Air Force Commander<br>
- Commander-in-Chief of the Navy<br>
- head of the intelligence service<br>

+ 3 add. military, where the commanders of specific branches of the military go (Airborne Forces in the Russian Federation, the ILC in the USA, the IRGC in Iran, etc.), as well as various prominent figures of the armed forces of the countries of the world who are not suitable for the previous 5 posts and the post of Minister of Defense.<br>
